--- How to use this module ---
-- antisnatchor:
 - the applet has been compiled with Java 1.6.0 update 0 in order to be compatible with every JRE > 1.6.x (1.7.x included)
 - tested with IE8 on XP SP3, and IE10 on Win7
 - tested with JRE 1.6.x and 1.7.x

 - I advise you to recompile/re-sign the applet yourself, the following are the required steps to compile and self-sign the applet.
NOTE: Best results are obtained signing the applet with a valid Code Signing certificate.

 - Ideally the dropper is a packed backdoor (Meterpreter?) that connects back to your server (for instance a Metasploit multi/handler).

1. compile the two classes
javac SignedApplet.java SM.java

2. create a JAR
jar cvf SignedApplet.jar SignedApplet.class SM.class

3. generate a keystore to self-sign the applet
keytool -keystore tmp -genkey

4. sign the applet
jarsigner -keystore tmp signedAppletCmdExec.jar mykey
