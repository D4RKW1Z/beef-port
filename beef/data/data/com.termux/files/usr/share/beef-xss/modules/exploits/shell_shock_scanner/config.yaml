            description: "This module attempts to get a reverse shell on the specified web server, blindly, by requesting ~400 potentially vulnerable CGI scripts. Each CGI is requested with a shellshock payload in the 'Accept' HTTP header.<br/>The list of CGI scripts was taken from <a href='https://github.com/nccgroup/shocker'>Shocker</a>.<br/><br/>The scan will take about 2 minutes with the default settings. Successful exploitation results in a reverse shell. Be sure to start your shell handler on the local port specified below."
