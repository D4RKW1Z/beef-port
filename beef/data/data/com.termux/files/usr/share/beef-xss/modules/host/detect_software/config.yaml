            description: "This module attempts to detect software installed on the host by using <a href='https://soroush.secproject.com/blog/2013/04/microsoft-xmldom-in-ie-can-divulge-information-of-local-drivenetwork-in-error-messages/'>Internet Explorer XMLDOM XXE</a> discovered by Soroush Dalili (@irsdl).<br/><br/>If the XMLDOM XXE technique fails, the module falls back to using the 'res' protocol handler to load known resource images from EXE/DLL files.<br/><br/>It also attempts to enumerate installed patches if service pack uninstall files are present on the host (WinXP only)."
