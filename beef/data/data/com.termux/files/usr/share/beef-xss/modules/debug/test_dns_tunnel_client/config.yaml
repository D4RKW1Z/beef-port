            description: "This module sends data one way over DNS, client to server only. BeEF's DNS server is used to reconstruct chunks of data being extruded via DNS. <br> Make sure that: <br>- the DNS extension is enabled, <br>- the DNS server is listening on port 53,<br>- the hooked browser is resolving the domain you specified via BeEF's DNS server.<br><br>By default all DNS requests used to extrude data return NXDomain responses."
